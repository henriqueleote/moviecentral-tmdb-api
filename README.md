# Frontend task



## Getting started

The goal is to build a frontend that handles a custom designed by you [restful API](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/) with a scaling architecture. 
We will walk you through the steps of setting up the base environment.
* Please fork this repository.

Our build tool of choice: [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

Preferable language/superset/syntax: **TypeScript**

Library: **React**


## Post initial setup

After you have successfully completed the setup of Vite+React, please install the following dependencies:
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial)
* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation)
* [Base Web](https://baseweb.design/getting-started/setup/)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

After you have ran the project please invest in writing a good README.md file which explains the essential goal of your project and install instructions.


## Structuring the code

The code structure should follow the following hirarchy:

* Views (that contain the functionality and is presented as core page component) 
* [Components (dummy;smart;pure;...)](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/react-all-about-components-35650a02ff50) & Styled (optional / if needed)
* Services (backend endpoints handler)


The rest is free for you to decide how to structure;-) 

## Going the extra mile
***not necessary***

- [ ] Write tests (unit / e2e)
- [ ] Setup Dockerfile
- [ ] Setup sample gitlab-ci file (Pipeline)
- [ ] [Deploy to pages with mockup backend](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/host-your-react-app-with-gitlab-c3ef2f93d0a2)
- [ ] Reference for axios, creating response mockups: https://blog.bitsrc.io/axios-mocking-with-reactjs-85d83d51704f?gi=3b4ecbee0e4b

## Finalizing
Create a Draft merge request and [assign me](https://gitlab.com/geovi) to review it.

Thanks for the effort, I will get back to you as soon as possible!
